🚀 Get Started

GitHub Repository: https://github.com/satyamhost/NUMBER-LOOKUP-osint-rax.git

Since I couldn't access the GitHub page to provide specific installation commands, I recommend the following steps:

1. Visit the Repository: Open the GitHub link on your device.
2. Check the README: Look for a README.md file—this almost always contains full installation instructions, requirements (like installing Python or specific libraries in Termux), and a usage guide.
3. Follow the Steps: Typically, for Termux, the process involves installing Python, cloning the repository, installing dependencies from a requirements.txt file, and then running the main Python script.

Disclaimer: This tool, like all resources from TEAM RAX, is intended for educational purposes and authorized security testing only. Always use it responsibly, ethically, and within legal boundaries.
